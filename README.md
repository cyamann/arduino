1st lab was for writing certain strings on lcd display using LiquidCrystal_I2C.
You could scroll right or left. It also can showcase certain turkish letters.

2nd lab was for binary counting up to 16 using resistors, leds and arduino.

3rd lab was playing a melody using a buzzer and button.

4th lab was used to detech tempature and humidity and print the result on the lcd display using the LiquidCrystal_I2C library.

5th lab was using the display to count hexadecimal numbers from 0 to F.

6th lab was  using the light sensor in certain thresholds.

7th lab was informing the users about distance which is in a certain threshold by buzzer.

8th lab was using the dc motor in certain gears and displaying these certain gears. This dc motor also could move forwards and backwards.

9th lab was using led lights and light sensor to print on the serial monitor about how many milliseconds ligth was on and light sensors output.

10th sensor was used to detect light, humidity and tempature. If these weren't on certain scala, it give an error on lcd display.
